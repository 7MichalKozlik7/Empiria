# Privacy Policy

**Last updated: November 29, 2025**

## Introduction

Empiria ("we", "our", or "the app") is committed to protecting your privacy. This Privacy Policy explains how we handle information when you use our macOS music player application.

## Information We Collect

**We do not collect any personal information.**

Empiria is designed to operate entirely on your local device. The app:

- Does not require user registration or accounts
- Does not collect or transmit personal data
- Does not use analytics or tracking services
- Does not access your contacts, calendar, or other personal information

## Local Data Storage

Empiria stores the following data locally on your device:

- **Music Library Database:** Information about audio files you import (file paths, metadata, album artwork)
- **User Preferences:** Your app settings, equalizer presets, and playback preferences
- **Playlists:** Playlists you create within the app

This data never leaves your device and is stored in your user Library folder.

## Internet Radio

When using the Internet Radio feature, the app connects directly to radio stream URLs. We do not log, track, or analyze your listening habits. The radio stations you listen to may have their own privacy policies.

## Third-Party Services

Empiria does not integrate with any third-party analytics, advertising, or data collection services.

## Data Security

Since all data is stored locally on your macOS device, it is protected by your system's security measures, including FileVault encryption if enabled.

## Children's Privacy

Empiria does not collect any personal information from anyone, including children under 13 years of age.

## Changes to This Policy

We may update this Privacy Policy from time to time. Any changes will be posted on this page with an updated revision date.
